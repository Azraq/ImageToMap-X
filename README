Dependencies:
gcc, zlib, gtk (, cNBT included in preoject (src/NBT/*))

The currently supportded platforms are: linux and windows (mac is barely supported)

Contact me on Github if you're an experienced Mac c++/c developer and can fix the Mac port.

If you're compiling this on anything but Linux you'll probably need to make your own build system, and if you have I would be very happy if you could send it and instructions on how to use it to me.

build with:
# make <platform>

The binaries are located in "bin/<platform>/".
